* Scheme (like) in Clojure

** Why? This seems very useless?

Yes it is! There is no reason besides: Because its fun.

** How do I use this?

With Clojure 1.9.x installed

#+BEGIN_SRC
clj -i clj -i src/lispclj/core.clj -r
Clojure 1.9.0
user=> (require '[lispclj.core :refer :all])
nil
user=> (lclj-rep "(begin (+ 1 1))")
2
#+END_SRC

* Missing

** TODO Repl - Yes this should be in here by ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

** TODO Main function to use as a Repl

** TODO Proper build to jar

** TODO Docstrings
